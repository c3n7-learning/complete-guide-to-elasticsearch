# `fuzzy` Query

Run:

```http
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "fuzzy": {
      "name": {
        "value": "LOBSTER",
        "fuzziness": "auto"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Output:

```json
{
  "took": 9,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 2,
    "successful": 2,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 0,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": null,
    "hits": []
  }
}
```

- The match query is a full-text query, and the fuzzy query is a term level query.
- The fuzzy query is thus not analyzed, thus ALL caps are not converted to lowercase
- Other than the analysis bit, the query works the same

```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "fuzzy": {
      "name": {
        "value": "lobster",
        "fuzziness": "auto"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Prefer a match query with a fuzziness paramter instead of `fuzzy`, unless you have a good reason not to.
